# matchingGame
Milestone Project #1, I'm building a matching game with a timer.  Match all of the tiles before time is up and you win, if time expires before all tiles are matched, you lose. 

Special thanks to everyone that helped me with this project including,
the course instructors, my friend Zach McMahon, Khurram Ghullamani, documentation (of course) and everyone that has put up with me during my software development journey.
